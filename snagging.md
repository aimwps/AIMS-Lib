to complete a benchmark...

    User clicks complete on part of pathway to complete (a benchmark)
        (via next in line)
        (via viewing complete pathway)

        User is taken to the benchmark home page

        Details are displayed of the stats


        e.g.
          Current status = Continue | new session
          Most recent completion = 86%
          Number of times completed = 4
          Best result = 97%

to record in pathways...
<organisation: Singularity Cafe>
is assigned the pathway : <pathway: hospitality health & safety>

  look up all members of that organisation:
      for each member: check each element of the pathway.

      oh look a benchmark: <benchmark_3: COSHH>

      check BenchmarkSessions for user, on_benchmark:

      queryset = all sessions for that benchmark for that user.
