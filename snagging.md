to record in pathways...
<organisation: Singularity Cafe>
is assigned the pathway : <pathway: hospitality health & safety>

  look up all members of that organisation:
      for each member: check each element of the pathway.

      oh look a benchmark: <benchmark_3: COSHH>

      check BenchmarkSessions for user, on_benchmark:

      queryset = all sessions for that benchmark for that user.
