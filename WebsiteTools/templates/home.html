  Aims is a feature that directs you towards your desired purpose. Set an aim for your life, declare behaviour's that you need. Take steps to make those behaviours habitual. Fulfil your aim. Based on cognitive behavioural therapy, the methodology replaces your preventative behaviours, thoughts and beliefs with productive ones.

    The library is a collection of <a href="#aimsInfo">Aims</a>, <a href="#pathwayInfo">Pathways</a> and <a href="#communityInfo">Community topics</a>, alongside our research on the best books, podcasts and applications for personal development. Workplaces will also find the tools we developed that allow employers to put employee development at the heart of their business.

    Pathways are a way to structure everything we learn. Revolving around three main features; articles, video lectures & benchmarks. Pathway creators can structure these documents to be completed in a certain order. We use AI question & answer generation for speedy creation of benchmarks so you can focus on quality content.

      <li class="list-group-item">Benchmark completion. Currently they can be generated but there is no application for using them.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Skillsets. These will be made by linking groups of pathways together to form a skill.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Refined question generation handling more document types. Automatically uploading PDF's for example.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Handling more datatypes. Currently the question generator operates from written articles only. In the future transcripts will be scraped or generated for more data & tabular data will also be an excepted data type</li>
